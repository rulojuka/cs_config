// View model offset, all -2 gives a "doomlike" feeling, but is optimal for clearer view
viewmodel_offset_x "-2" // Valid values are between -2.00 and 2.50
viewmodel_offset_y "-2" // Valid values are between -2.00 and 2.00.
viewmodel_offset_z "-2" // Valid values are between -2.00 and 2.00.

// View model field of view. Seems pretty personal to me. Lower is slightly better for clearer view
viewmodel_fov "54" // Valid values are between 54.00 and 68.00.
